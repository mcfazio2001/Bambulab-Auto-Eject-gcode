# Bambulab-Auto-Eject-gcode
Automate your Bambulab printers with auto eject

This repository contains G-code scripts for BambuLab printers that automatically eject completed prints from the build plate. It’s designed to simplify multi-part or batch printing by removing the need to manually remove prints after each job.

Use at your own risk.

For continuous or looping prints, consider using PrintAgo
